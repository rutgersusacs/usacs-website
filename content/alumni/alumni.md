### Realize that there’s no one way to succeed.

This doc is already huge, so it can be overwhelming. But all of it is advice made in an attempt to help you be your best.

This is a roadmap that worked for one person. Everyone’s path is different. Make the most of your own.

Figure out what fulfills you. For me, it was organizing and improving the CS community at Rutgers. I sometimes felt like an impostor because my biggest extracurricular involvement was about a community within tech, instead of tech itself. But that was what made me feel like I had an impact.

Remember that humans are multidimensional — you can be successful and interesting even if your whole life isn’t about writing code.

### Don’t let fear be the reason behind your choices.

I avoided applying to jobs and internships for a very long time because I thought I would be exposed as a total failure.

Turns out this thought process was a waste of my own time that never did anything useful for me. It’s okay to be afraid — everyone is. Just don’t let that stop you, because it’s not worth it.

Work on replacing your fear of the unknown with curiosity about it.

Embrace uncertainty. Stand up for your notions, but get comfortable with being wrong and admitting it.

Surround yourself with people who encourage you and push you to do more and be better, even if you’re afraid.

Try to gain an understanding of how people work.

People who loudly brag about their careers, interviews, skills, or classes are often acting out of insecurity.

Tech has a long way to go when it comes to being inclusive. Educate yourself and listen to others’ experiences.

Aim to grow. You can’t be your high school self forever.

Check in on your own thoughts and behaviors often. Don’t be a jerk.

### Do what you enjoy.

You’re in charge of your own life. Keep an open mind and pursue what sparks your curiosity.

I struggled with this while applying for full-time roles. As a CS grad, I felt expected to fit an engineering mold, even though I never programmed outside of classes.

Eventually, I tried a community-oriented role at Major League Hacking and realized I loved seeing people grow.

### You are worth someone else’s time and energy.

Your mental health directly impacts your school and social life.

After talking to someone I trusted, I noticed I bounced back much faster from negative thought spirals.

Finding that “someone” during sophomore year changed my confidence, mental health, and academics.

### Reflect and recognize your personal growth every semester.

It’s easy to compare yourself to others, especially as responsibilities pile up.

I used to compare myself to friends in higher-level classes and leadership roles. Then I remembered where I started.

In just one year, I grew more than I ever expected — and that realization pushed me to keep going.

### A simple productivity guideline

My dad told me to not go home until it’s 10 PM every day.

It’s a surprisingly helpful way to check whether you’re actually being productive.
